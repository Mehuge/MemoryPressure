# Memory Pressure

Memory Pressure is a lightweight yet powerful Windows utility designed for developers, testers, and system analysts who need to simulate specific high-memory conditions. Ever wondered how your application behaves when physical RAM is scarce? Memory Pressure gives you precise control, allowing you to set a target memory usage percentage and watch as it carefully allocates memory to meet that goal. Its intelligent 'keep-alive' mechanism ensures the allocated memory stays in physical RAM—not swapped to disk—providing a true-to-life pressure test. With an optional 'hold' feature to prevent memory from being released, it's the perfect tool for reliably testing out-of-memory scenarios, analyzing performance bottlenecks, or simply understanding how your system and applications perform under stress.
